       * The order of data nodes in LocatedBlock returned by name node is sorted 
       * by NetworkToplology#pseudoSortByDistance. In current MiniDFSCluster, 
       * when LocatedBlock is returned, the sorting is based on a random order.
       * That is to say, the DFS client and simulated data nodes in mini DFS
       * cluster are considered not on the same host nor the same rack.
       * Therefore, even we corrupted the first two block replicas based in 
       * order. When DFSClient read some block replicas, it is not guaranteed 
       * which block replicas (good/bad) will be returned first. So we try to 
       * re-read the file until we know the expected replicas numbers is 
       * returned.
