   * Creates a block with all datanodes on the same rack. Add additional
   * datanodes on a different rack and increase the replication factor, 
   * making sure there are enough replicas across racks. If the previous
   * test passes this one should too, however this test may pass when
   * the previous one fails because the replication code is explicitly
   * triggered by setting the replication factor.
